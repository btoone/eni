Create notes:

    require 'rbosa'
    app = OSA.app('Evernote')
    app.create_note(:with_text => "hello world", :title => "Test Note", :notebook => "Wedding")

Get list of notes:

    require 'rbosa'
    notebooks = app.notebooks.get       # => need to call get() on OSA objects to get normal objects
    notebooks.each { |n| puts n.name }
    
    # use the OSA convenience method #every to collect list attributes
    app.notebooks.every(:name)
