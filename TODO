Create notes:

    require 'rbosa'
    app = OSA.app('Evernote')
    app.create_note(:with_text => "hello world", :title => "Test Note", :notebook => "Wedding")
    
The create_note method returns a note object (OSA::Evernote::Note).  The :notebook must be the exact name (case sensitive) or else it will error with:

    RuntimeError: application returned error: siInitSPTblErr / dsIllInstErr / scArbNBErr / ESRCH (3), with message: Notebook names must be unique
      from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rubyosa-0.4.0/lib/rbosa.rb:773:in `__send_event__'
      from /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rubyosa-0.4.0/lib/rbosa.rb:773:in `create_note'
      from (irb):4


Get list of notes:

    require 'rbosa'
    notebooks = app.notebooks.get       # => need to call get() on OSA objects to get normal objects
    notebooks.each { |n| puts n.name }
    
    # use the OSA convenience method #every to collect list attributes
    app.notebooks.every(:name)
